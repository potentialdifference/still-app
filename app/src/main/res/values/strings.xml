    <string name="image_caption_1">Vivian Maier was born, in poverty, in 1926, in the Bronx, New York City, and at age 6, her mother, now separated from Vivian\'s father, took her to the Alpine village of Saint-Bonnet-en-Champsaur in South East France, birthplace of her mother. Vivian was schooled in France from age 6 to 12 when she returned with her mother to New York. </string>
    <string name="image_caption_2">We know Vivian worked in factories and sweatshops, but it wasn\'t until her mid-twenties that her photographic life started to take off: buying herself an iconic Rolleiflex camera she started photographing the buildings and people of the Big Apple. </string>
    <string name="image_caption_3">In 1956, for unknown reasons, Vivian moved to Chicago in 1956, devoting her life to nannying, while using every moment of her spare time to photograph everything from the children she looked after, to street scenes around Chicago.</string>
    <string name="image_caption_4">Vivian seemed to show an especial interest in photographing the poor and destitute, venturing into some of the most notoriously rough areas of Chicago to take her pictures.</string>
    <string name="image_caption_5">In later life, without work and low on funds, Vivian might have been forced to live on the streets she once photographed, if two brothers, former charges of hers, hadn\'t found her and rented her an apartment for the rest of her days. </string>
    <string name="image_caption_6">Vivian Maier died on the 21st April 2009 after a fall on an icy pavement, a sad end to a lonely life, but the beginning of the adventure that, with the help of fortune and three Chicago men, was to bring the genius of Vivian Maier to the world.</string>
